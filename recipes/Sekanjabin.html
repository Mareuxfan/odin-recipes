    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>honey</li>
        <li>white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Fresh Mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the sugar and water into a saucepan. Place over high heat stir to dissolve the sugar and bring to a simmer. Boiling the syrup over medium-low heat prevents the sugar from crystallizing.

        <li>Add mint sprigs to the warm and simmering syrup.
        </li>
        <li>Continue heating until the syrup thickens. To make sure our syrup has the right thickness to add vinegar, just take a spoonful of the syrup and pour a drop of it into a glass of cold water. If it settles, it means that it has a suitable thickness, but if it dissolves in water, it means that it still needs to be simmered for a while.
        </li>
        <li>When the syrup reaches the right thickness, add the vinegar and let it simmer for another 10-15 minutes. Then take the mint leaves out of the syrup and pass the syrup through a strainer.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the syrup into a clean glass container without moisture and put it in the refrigerator.
        </li>
    </ol>
